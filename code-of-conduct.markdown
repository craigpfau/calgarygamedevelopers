# Code of Conduct

All **community participants**--including members and guests of members, event hosts, sponsors, presenters, exhibitors and attendees--are expected to abide by this code of conduct.

By becoming a member of Calgary Game Developers, or attending or hosting any event in any capacity, you agree to abide by this code of conduct, and cooperate with organizers who enforce it.

## Expected Behavior

We insist that everyone who uses group spaces remains mindful of, and takes responsibility for, their speech and behavior. This includes:

- Always acting out of respect and concern for the free expression of others.
- Actively listening to others and not dominating discussions.
- Respecting physical and emotional boundaries. Always ask before touching, and check in before discussing topics that may be triggering.
- Not making assumptions about identity, experiences, or preferred pronouns.
- Not using words that are racist, sexist, homophobic, classist, transphobic, cissexist or ableist.
- Humbly accepting respectful correction (or correcting yourself!), keeping in mind that the impact of your words on other people is more important than your intent.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We believe that failing to address dynamics of hierarchy, power and privilege alienates and further victimizes our members and prevents us from creating the safe equitable space we want.

**We do not tolerate oppressive behavior, harassment, destructive behavior, or exclusionary actions.**

**Oppressive behavior**: any conduct that demeans, marginalizes, rejects, threatens or harms anyone on the basis of identity, background, or ability.

**Harassment**: deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; disruption of events; aggressive, derogatory, or threatening comments; and unwanted physical contact or sexual attention.

**Destructive behavior**: damaging or altering any part of the building, inside or out, including furniture, equipment, or other people's belongings.

**Exclusionary actions**: denying certain participants opportunities to share views, skills and other contributions; engaging in favoritism; and creating or reinforcing an inequitable learning environment.

## Enforcement

Anyone‭ ‬asked‭ ‬to‭ ‬stop‭ ‬unacceptable‭ ‬behavior‭ ‬is‭ ‬expected‭ ‬to‭ ‬comply‭ ‬immediately.

Anyone who engages in sustained ‬unacceptable behavior may be sanctioned ‬or‭ ‬permanent‭ly ‬expelled‭ ‬from‭ ‬the‭ ‬community‭ ‬without‭ ‬warning‭ (‬and‭ ‬without‭ ‬refund‭ ‬in‭ ‬the‭ ‬case‭ ‬of‭ ‬a‭ ‬paid‭ ‬event‭)‬.

### What to do if you need help

If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, or experience marginalizing or silencing behavior that limits your full participation in any Calgary Game Developers event, please talk to any of the following people:

- The host of the event you are attending (listed on the event page)
- [Craig Pfau][1]

Your conversation will be held in confidence.

When you come to us with a problem during an event, it is our top priority to help you feel safe as quickly as possible. Next, a small group of community organizers will meet to decide what our response will be. Then, we will warn or remove the offender depending on the circumstances, taking your and the community's safety and wishes into account.

Community‭ ‬organizers‭ ‬are‭ ‬available‭ ‬to‭ ‬help‭ you ‬engage‭ ‬with‭ ‬local‭ ‬law‭ ‬enforcement (solely at your request).

*By registering for or hosting an event, you agree to make your name visible to event organizers and facility staff. This visibility helps maintain the safety of our space. Anyone not registered for an event may be denied entry at the discretion of the event host.*
